I am an early career scientist from France interested in viral interference and the biology of viral co-infection, with the objective of developing novel therapies against herpesviruses. I am committed to making Academia a better place for everyone and believe that all research should be made open-access.
Outside of the lab, you'll find me exploring the mountains under the California sun, or enjoying a glass of wine at the end of the day. (And if you are still wondering, yes, french wine is better!)
