Hi! I'm Marius, a virologist and molecular biologist at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle, USA.

## Background
I am a graduate from the Ecole Polytechnique in France, and have a Master of Genetics from Paris University. I received my PhD from the [Curie Institute](https://institut-curie.org/) and Sorbonne University in Paris and then moved to San Francisco for a postdoc at the [Buck Institute](https://www.buckinstitute.org/). I am currently a staff scientist in the lab of Keith Jerome at the [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org) in Seattle.

## Research Interests

### Viral Gene Drive in herpesviruses
My research focuses on herpesviruses, a family of ubiquitous DNA viruses that chronically infect most of the human population and represent a heavy burden on human health. I invented a new therapeutic strategy against herpesviruses, using engineered “gene drive” viruses that can replace wild-type viruses with an attenuated version to potentially reduce viral levels and suppress symptoms. This discovery was inspired by the gene drives developed in insects and represents a new way to engineer herpesviruses. My current work centers on exploring the potential of the technology for therapeutic and research purposes.
