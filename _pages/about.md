Hi! I'm Marius, a molecular biologist and virologist in San Francisco, California.

## Background
I received my PhD from the [Curie Institute](https://institut-curie.org/) and Sorbonne University in Paris. Before that, I graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique in France, and received a Master of Genetics from Paris University. Since 2016, I've been working in the lab of Eric Verdin at the [Buck Institute](https://www.buckinstitute.org/), near San Francisco.

## Research Interests

### Viral Interference in herpesviruses

I am interested in developing cutting-edge approaches to study viral pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions, with the objective of inventing novel therapies against viruses, and especially herpesviruses. With Eric Verdin at the Buck Institute, we developed a CRISPR-based system of viral interference in herpesviruses. Our interfering strategy was inspired by the “gene drives” developed in insects. It causes the conversion of wild-type viruses into new recombinant viruses and drives the native viral population to extinction. Our discovery represents a novel way to engineer viruses for therapeutic and research purposes.We are currently developing in vivo models of viral gene drive, and are using the technology to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of viral co-infection and recombination.

### Role of SIRT5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection

In collaboration with UCSF and the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, we are investigating the interaction between the viral proofreading enzyme Nsp14 and human Sirtuins, a class of lysine deacetylases critical for cell metabolism. Our research is highlighting unknown mechanisms by which the virus hijack the cellular machinery and counteract innate immune defense, potentially paving the way for novel therapeutic interventions against COVID19.
